          <p id="isPasted">In the wake of the pandemic and emergent shopping habits by shoppers, retailers are blindsided by shortages. Panic buying has decimated grocery stores, and small retailers are reeling, some with inventory down by 58%!&nbsp;</p>
          <p>How can you manage your inventory to please your clients with so much uncertainty? Read on to find out how you can minimize the bullwhip effect!&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>The Bullwhip Effect</h2>
          <p>You might find yourself asking, what is the bullwhip effect? It's a phenomenon that describes the supply chain issues at each point. It begins when customers engage in unpredictable shopping habits. Retailers react by saturating the errant demand through larger orders.</p>
          <p>These larger orders increase stress on distributors, who often react the same way: increasing order size. The final chain is the manufacturer, attempting to manage the over-ordering.</p>
          <p>You can visualize the bullwhip effect like a person cracking a whip. The ripples are small near the person but huge at the end of the whip. If the customer is the person, the retailer is the whip's handle. The distributor is in the middle of the whip, with the manufacturer being the tail of the whip.&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>How Do You Insulate Your Business?</h2>
          <p>Retailers have used demand signals from shopping habits to focus their orders in the past. World events have created mass distortions in demand yield forecasts. Inefficient supply chains and low inventory are typical due to these outdated forecasts.</p>
          <p>The pandemic distortions have made forecasting demand yield impossible. These signals are no longer accurate. Retailers have maintained their traditional signal forecasting, growing their orders by magnitudes. But these efforts continue to create the bullwhip effect.</p>
          <p>With many large retailers operating in a reactive mode, the disorders have become systemic. The resultant static forecasts are inaccurate and ineffective at predicting demand and satiating supply.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>So how do you insulate yourself and your business from these adverse effects? It has become impossible for standard methods to predict demand. Minimizing the bullwhip effect is critical. You need a new paradigm in demand signal forecasting to assess the situation accurately.&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>AI: Making the Impossible Possible With Assortment Simulation</h2>
          <p>As mentioned above, poor demand forecasting has aggravated supply chain inefficiencies further. AI and machine learning models can simulate different demand signals and their impacts. With these powerful tools and simulations, you can plan for unexpected scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>They are conversational and fluid in nature, allowing you to pick the best solution and actions based on different objectives and constraints. [redacted] [redacted]® is goal-oriented, not process-oriented. It is designed to give you the best plan of action to achieve your goals based on constraints.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>These machine learning tools are trained with years of data and deliver plans of action modeled with demand signal datasets. The best part? Our tools are easy to use and understand! Pose a question, and the AI will simulate constraints and outcomes and deliver a goal-oriented solution! Want to increase supply but limit churn? [redacted]® has a plan for that!</p>
          <p>No longer will you be bound by static merchandising plans that fail to account for unpredictable markets. The new paradigm is augmented and dynamic decision-making processes that include these unforeseen factors. Our tools' design is to achieve the best outcomes for your business, even when market signals are unpredictable.</p>
          <h2>Accurate, Effective Solutions</h2>
