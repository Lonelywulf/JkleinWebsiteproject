          <p id="isPasted">The world of marketing and advertising is always changing. One constant for several decades, however, are cookies. More than 80% of advertisers rely on third-party cookies for their advertising revenue!&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Recent changes at Apple and Google have changed the playing field, however. For better or for worse, the marketing industry is about to change. The era of third-party cookies is about to die, and a broad swath of advertising with it.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Unless, of course, marketers change course and adapt to new methodologies to capture users. Keep reading to learn how quality content from [redacted] can drive CTR while maintaining end-user privacy!</p>
          <h2>The End of Third-Party Cookies</h2>
          <p>Google announced in 2020 that they would phase out browser support for third-party cookies, with the current timeline for that change in 2023. Apple also recently announced changes to its platform, tanking Facebook stock by 26%.</p>
          <p>Facebook built a massive company on the concept of advertising to targeted users, but these changes from Apple and Google have already upended their business model. As the advertising world shifts gears, many look towards first-party cookies as a solution.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>However, quality content engaging with the user is better than first-party cookies! Your marketing campaigns can circumvent the lack of cookies by driving conversion through relevant and quality content pieces.&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>Content Marketing </h2>
          <p>"Content is King" has long been a phrase used online, implying that nothing else matters if you don't have the content to back it up. As the world moves away from third-party cookies, content has become a sought-after tool in the marketer's belt.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>From lead generation to advertisements to CTR, quality content that engages the user is more important than ever before. Good content ranges from blog posts like this one to short videos, infographics, and more. One performant option is lead stories!</p>
          <h2>Lead Stories</h2>
          <p>If you've ever used Facebook or Instagram for any period, you've likely encountered stories. These are short, often multi-stage infographics or videos. Leveraging the power of stories, both on third-party sites and on your pages, enables you to engage with quality content.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Stories can range from infographics about a product to recipes to videos and more! They can also be tailored to specific lengths or other factors to cater to users' short attention spans.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Because stories are interactable and contain information a person is likely already looking for, you've got the hook in place! Including links to your products or services is easy and integrates smoothly with the overall story.&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>Protecting Privacy</h2>
          <p>One of the main reasons both Apple and Google have pursued the death of third-party cookies is user privacy. Governments and individuals are increasingly wary of corporations and want to protect themselves from tracking and intrusion. More and more customers block third-party cookies to prevent tracking.</p>
          <p>Recent legislation in the EU, known as GDPR, aims to safeguard users' privacy.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Even if you don't have a market in the EU, keeping your advertising compliant with GDPR principles is important. If you ever enter the European market, your content will be ready!&nbsp;</p>
